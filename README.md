# battleships-microbit
This is a micro:bit game project that I created in school with JavaScript (or TypeScript if you want to be precise.). It is a battleships game.

## How to play
Wait until the "Game Start" message has finished appearing, then pick your spot.<br/>
You can press A to move.

If you have locked in your position, then press A and B to send it to the other micro:bit.<br/>
Next, the first player presses A and B. If you lose, you will be projected a massage saying "you lose".
